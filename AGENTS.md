# AGENTS.md — csctf Project

## RULE 1 – ABSOLUTE (DO NOT EVER VIOLATE THIS)

You may NOT delete any file or directory unless I explicitly give the exact command **in this session**.

- This includes files you just created (tests, tmp files, scripts, etc.).
- You do not get to decide that something is "safe" to remove.
- If you think something should be removed, stop and ask. You must receive clear written approval **before** any deletion command is even proposed.

Treat "never delete files without permission" as a hard invariant.

---

## IRREVERSIBLE GIT & FILESYSTEM ACTIONS

Absolutely forbidden unless I give the **exact command and explicit approval** in the same message:

- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`
- `rm -rf`
- Any command that can delete or overwrite code/data

Rules:

1. If you are not 100% sure what a command will delete, do not propose or run it. Ask first.
2. Prefer safe tools: `git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups, etc.
3. After approval, restate the command verbatim, list what it will affect, and wait for confirmation.
4. When a destructive command is run, record in your response:
   - The exact user text authorizing it
   - The command run
   - When you ran it

If that audit trail is missing, then you must act as if the operation never happened.

---

## Node / JS Toolchain

- Use **bun** for everything JS/TS.
- ❌ Never use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
- Lockfiles: only `bun.lock`. Do not introduce any other lockfile.
- Target **latest Node.js**. No need to support old Node versions.

---

## Project Architecture

This is a **single-file CLI tool** (`src/index.ts`, ~3000 lines). The architecture is intentionally monolithic for simplicity and to produce a single compiled executable.

Key patterns:
- **Provider detection**: URL patterns → `Provider` type (`chatgpt`, `gemini`, `grok`, `claude`)
- **Selector discovery**: Provider-specific CSS selector arrays with fallback chains
- **Browser automation**: Playwright with stealth measures and CDP fallback for Cloudflare-protected sites
- **Output formatting**: Markdown with optional HTML (syntax-highlighted via highlight.js)

Build targets:
```bash
bun run build              # Local binary → dist/csctf
bun run build:all          # Cross-platform builds
bun run check              # Lint + typecheck
```

When adding features:
- Add to `src/index.ts` directly; do not split into modules unless absolutely necessary.
- Follow existing patterns for provider support, selector fallbacks, and error handling.
- Test with `bun run src/index.ts <url>` before compiling.

---

## Code Editing Discipline

- Do **not** run scripts that bulk-modify code (codemods, invented one-off scripts, giant `sed`/regex refactors).
- Large mechanical changes: break into smaller, explicit edits and review diffs.
- Subtle/complex changes: edit by hand, file-by-file, with careful reasoning.

---

## Backwards Compatibility & File Sprawl

We optimize for a clean architecture now, not backwards compatibility.

- No "compat shims" or "v2" file clones.
- When changing behavior, migrate callers and remove old code **inside the same file**.
- New files are only for genuinely new domains that don't fit existing modules.
- The bar for adding files is very high.

---

## Console Output

This CLI uses `chalk` for colored console output. Patterns to follow:

```typescript
console.error(chalk.blue('[1/8] Step description'))     // Progress steps
console.error(chalk.gray('    Details...'))             // Indented details
console.error(chalk.yellow('\n⚠️  Warning message'))    // Warnings
console.error(chalk.red('✖ Error message'))             // Errors
console.error(chalk.green('✔ Success message'))         // Success
```

Rules:
- All progress/status goes to `stderr` (so stdout remains clean for piping)
- Main output (markdown/HTML) goes to `stdout`
- Quiet mode (`--quiet`) suppresses progress messages but not errors

---

## Third-Party Libraries

When unsure of an API, look up current docs (late-2025) rather than guessing.

Key dependencies:
- **playwright-chromium**: Browser automation with stealth measures
- **chalk**: Terminal coloring
- **markdown-it**: Markdown rendering
- **highlight.js**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **turndown**: HTML-to-Markdown conversion

---

## Provider-Specific Patterns

When adding a new provider:

1. Add to `Provider` type union
2. Add URL patterns to `PROVIDER_PATTERNS`
3. Add CSS selector fallback chains to `SELECTOR_FALLBACKS`
4. Update `sharePattern` regex for URL validation
5. Test in both headless and headful modes
6. Handle Cloudflare/bot-detection if present (may need CDP mode)

CDP Mode (for Cloudflare-protected sites):
- Connects to user's real Chrome via `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
- Saves/restores user's open tabs (macOS only via AppleScript)
- Prompts user to solve Cloudflare challenges manually

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

Agent Mail is available as an MCP server for coordinating work across agents.

What Agent Mail gives:
- Identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads.
- Advisory file reservations (leases) to avoid agents clobbering each other.
- Persistent artifacts in git (human-auditable).

Core patterns:

1. **Same repo**
   - Register identity:
     - `ensure_project` then `register_agent` with the repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before editing:
     - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)`.
   - Communicate:
     - `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`.
     - `fetch_inbox`, then `acknowledge_message`.
   - Fast reads:
     - `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20`.
     - `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.

2. **Macros vs granular:**
   - Prefer macros when speed is more important than fine-grained control:
     - `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
   - Use granular tools when you need explicit behavior.

Common pitfalls:
- "from_agent not registered" → call `register_agent` with correct `project_key`.
- `FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT` → adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation.

## Testing

```bash
bun test                   # Unit tests
bun run test:e2e           # E2E tests (requires CSCTF_E2E=1)
```

For manual testing:
```bash
# Test a provider
bun run src/index.ts https://chatgpt.com/share/<id>
bun run src/index.ts https://gemini.google.com/share/<id>
bun run src/index.ts https://x.com/i/grok/share/<id>
bun run src/index.ts https://claude.ai/share/<id>  # Requires CDP mode

# Test output formats
bun run src/index.ts <url> --html        # Markdown + HTML
bun run src/index.ts <url> --json        # JSON output
bun run src/index.ts <url> -o output.md  # Write to file
```

## Using bv as an AI Sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Other bv Commands

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level` (healthy\|warning\|critical), `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles introduced/resolved |

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```

Use bv instead of parsing beads.jsonl—it computes PageRank, critical paths, cycles, and parallel tracks deterministically.

## ast-grep vs ripgrep (quick guidance)

**Use `ast-grep` when structure matters.** It parses code and matches AST nodes, so results ignore comments/strings, understand syntax, and can **safely rewrite** code.

* Refactors/codemods: rename APIs, change import forms, rewrite call sites or variable kinds.
* Policy checks: enforce patterns across a repo (`scan` with rules + `test`).
* Editor/automation: LSP mode; `--json` output for tooling.

**Use `ripgrep` when text is enough.** It's the fastest way to grep literals/regex across files.

* Recon: find strings, TODOs, log lines, config values, or non-code assets.
* Pre-filter: narrow candidate files before a precise pass.

**Rule of thumb**

* Need correctness over speed, or you'll **apply changes** → start with `ast-grep`.
* Need raw speed or you're just **hunting text** → start with `rg`.
* Often combine: `rg` to shortlist files, then `ast-grep` to match/modify with precision.

**Snippets**

Find structured code (ignores comments/strings):

```bash
ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'import $X from "$P"'
```

Codemod (only real `var` declarations become `let`):

```bash
ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'var $A = $B' -r 'let $A = $B' -U
```

Quick textual hunt:

```bash
rg -n 'console\.log\(' -t ts
```

Combine speed + precision:

```bash
rg -l -t ts 'chalk\.' | xargs ast-grep run -l TypeScript -p 'chalk.$METHOD($ARGS)' --json
```

**Mental model**

* Unit of match: `ast-grep` = node; `rg` = line.
* False positives: `ast-grep` low; `rg` depends on your regex.
* Rewrites: `ast-grep` first-class; `rg` requires ad-hoc sed/awk and risks collateral edits.

## Morph Warp Grep — AI-Powered Code Search

Use `mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep` for "how does X work?" discovery across the codebase.

When to use:

- You don't know where something lives.
- You want data flow across multiple files (CLI → provider → parser → output).
- You want all touchpoints of a cross-cutting concern (e.g., selector discovery, browser automation).

Example:

```
mcp__morph-mcp__warp_grep(
  repoPath: "/data/projects/chat_shared_conversation_to_file",
  query: "How does the provider detection work for different chat services?"
)
```

Warp Grep:

- Expands a natural-language query to multiple search patterns.
- Runs targeted greps, reads code, follows imports, then returns concise snippets with line numbers.
- Reduces token usage by returning only relevant slices, not entire files.

When **not** to use Warp Grep:

- You already know the function/identifier name; use `rg`.
- You know the exact file; just open it.
- You only need a yes/no existence check.

Comparison:

| Scenario | Tool |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| "How does provider detection work?" | warp_grep |
| "Where is `SELECTOR_FALLBACKS` defined?" | `rg` |
| "Replace `var` with `let`" | `ast-grep` |

## Beads Workflow Integration

**Note:** `br` (beads_rust) is non-invasive and never executes git commands. You must run git commands manually after `br sync --flush-only`.

When starting a beads-tracked task:

1. **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `br ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2. **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")`
3. **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4. **Work and update**
   - Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5. **Complete and release**
   - `br close br-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat-sheet:
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `br-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[br-###] ...`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `br-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `br-###` for traceability

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync --flush-only
   git add .beads/
   git commit -m "sync beads" --allow-empty
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Note for Codex/GPT-5.2

If you are Codex or GPT-5.2 (or any non-Claude agent): another agent (often Claude Code) may have made changes to the working tree since you last saw it. Before assuming your mental model of the code is correct:

1. Run `git status` to see uncommitted changes
2. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits
3. Re-read any files you plan to modify

This prevents you from overwriting another agent's work or making edits based on stale context
